need 3 documents:
1. the textArray from the db (originally from sefaria)
2. need the lines as jsonPassages also stored in a db (scraped from mercava)
3. then we need mapping json files, also stored in db (created by an LLM like gpt-mini, give it one example, should be enough)
the mapping is from the words in the jsonPassages to the textArray, it assigns passage ids to the words
this needs to be done seperately for talmud and rashi. For tosafost we only need the jsonPassages, since we have no translations now

const [isTHD, setIsTHD] = useState(false); on page.jsx controls which version to show
